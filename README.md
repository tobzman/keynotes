## Description

Note Taker is a web application that allows users to write and save notes. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for organising thoughts and keeping track of tasks.

The application uses an Express.js back end to handle API routes and a JSON file to store the note data. Users can create new notes, view existing notes, and delete notes they no longer need.
